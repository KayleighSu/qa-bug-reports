**Title:**

Out Dated Information on website

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Got to [newwindsormusicacademy.com](https://newwindsormusicacademy.com)
2. Scroll down on the page until you see the title "Why New Windsr Music Academy is the Hudson Valley's #1 choice for music lessons."
3. Observe the paragraph to the right which states "...active enrollemnt of 650 students..."
4. Scroll down until you see the title "Instruments & Instruction In:"
5. Observe the description which includes "Band (Rock/Pop, Jazz, Country/Blues)" - a category we no longer offer instruction in.

**Expected Result:**
Information should be updated to be current for the website.

**Actual Result:**
Information is not updated or current for the website. We should want to showcase that we have an active enrollment of over 1,000 students, not 650, and we should be advertising for only the instruments that we offer.

## Severity:
**Medium to High**
Having the incorrect active enrollment number makes the school seem like it hasn't grown since hitting 650 students. Also, having the incorrect active enrollment number makes our ads seem like they are lying to potential clients. 
Stating we offer a program that we don't offer can cause confusion for students looking for band practices.
