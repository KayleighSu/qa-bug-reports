**TITLE:** Page content loads without styling briefly before fully rendering

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Go to [tomiller.com](https://tomiller.com)
2. Refresh the page a few times
3. Watch initial page rendering sequence (especially the top menu)

**Expected Result:**
Content loads with styling applied immediately, with no visible layout shift.

**Actual Result:**
For a brief moment, the page appears unstyled text or raw markup before styles are applied, causing layout shift and unpolished loading behavior.

## severity: 
**Low to Medium:** 
Not a major issue, but disrupts the first impression and may make the site appear unrefined.

**Environment:**
- Browser: Microsoft Edge
- OS: Windows 11 Pro
- CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 7600X 6-Core Processor (4.70GHz)
- GPU: B650 EAGLE AX
- RAM: 32GB
- Display: 1920 x 1080 @ 60Hz
