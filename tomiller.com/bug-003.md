**TITLE:** Page content loads without styling briefly before fully rendering

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Go to https://tomiller.com
2. Refresh the page a few times
3. Watch initial page rendering sequence (especailly the top menu)

Content loads with styling applied immediately, with no visible layout shift.

**Actual Result:**
For a brief moment, the page appears unstyled text or raw markup before styles are applied, causing layout shift and unpolished loading behavior.
